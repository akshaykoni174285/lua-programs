-- now you can print something by using a print function 

print("lua programming is so fun and i am loving it ")
-- but if you want to add two string then if you use comma it will look something like this 

print("lua programming is so fun","i am loving it")
-- this will actually append a tab space between the two strings 

print("lua programming is so fun ".."i am loving it")

-- this will concatinate the two strings
